git clone ssh.....or http =>
	'' Makes a Git repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote source you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions.''

git add =>
	''Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. Example: git add .''

git commit =>
	Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit.

		git commit -a -m ‘committing all changes == equals to git add and git commit’

git status =>

git log =>
	Shows a listing of commits on a branch including the corresponding details.

git show =>
